Project Title: Big Mart Sales Prediction using Linear Regression

Overview:

This project involves predicting the sales of products sold in Big Mart outlets based on various factors such as item type, outlet location, outlet size, item visibility, item weight, etc. The project will use linear regression as the machine learning algorithm to train the model.

Data Source:

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains 8,523 records with 12 columns including item identifier, item weight, item fat content, item visibility, item type, item mrp (maximum retail price), outlet identifier, outlet establishment year, outlet size, outlet location type, outlet type, and sales.

Conclusion:

This project aims to predict the sales of products sold in Big Mart outlets using linear regression. By training the model on a dataset containing various factors that affect sales, it will help the company to make more accurate predictions of future sales and optimize its inventory and pricing strategies.
