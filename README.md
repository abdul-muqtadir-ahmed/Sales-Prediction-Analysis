Project Title: Big Mart Sales Prediction using Linear Regression

Overview:

This project involves predicting the sales of products sold in Big Mart outlets based on various factors such as item type, outlet location, outlet size, item visibility, item weight, etc. The project will use linear regression as the machine learning algorithm to train the model.

Data Source:

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains 8,523 records with 12 columns including item identifier, item weight, item fat content, item visibility, item type, item mrp (maximum retail price), outlet identifier, outlet establishment year, outlet size, outlet location type, outlet type, and sales.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

The dataset will be cleaned by removing any missing or invalid data points. The categorical variables will be converted to numerical values using label encoding to make them suitable for linear regression. The dataset will then be split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Model Building and Training:

The linear regression model will be built using the scikit-learn library in Python. The training set will be used to fit the model and the testing set will be used to evaluate the performance of the model. The model will be trained using various regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.

Model Evaluation:

The performance of the model will be evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, and mean absolute error. The evaluation results will be visualized using plots to help understand the model's performance.

Conclusion:

This project aims to predict the sales of products sold in Big Mart outlets using linear regression. By training the model on a dataset containing various factors that affect sales, it will help the company to make more accurate predictions of future sales and optimize its inventory and pricing strategies.
